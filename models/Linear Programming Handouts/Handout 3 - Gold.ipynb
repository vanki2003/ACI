    "A gold processor has two sources of gold ore, source A and source B. \n",

    "Moreover, Federal Regulations require that the amount of ore from source B cannot exceed twice the amount of ore from source A. \n",

    "If ore from source A yields 2 oz. of gold per ton, and ore from source B yields 3 oz. of gold per ton, how many tons of ore from both sources must be processed each day to maximize the amount of gold extracted subject to the above constraints?\n",
